# <RFC title>

## Summary

Deprecate Ember.AutoLocation and related APIs. In next major version,
make history the default location (instead of auto).

## Motivation

In practice, 'auto' will almost always resolve to the 'history' location.

By removing the 'auto' location and setting 'history' as the default we're removing
some complexity around router location, with no downside for users, since they
all get it resolved to history anyway.

## Background

The Ember Router can use different mechanisms to serialize its state.
The two common ones are 'history' and 'hash'. There is also a special
location called 'auto' which does feature detection, preferring 'history'.

Basically all browsers will get 'history':
https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_history_pushstate

The check 'auto' is basically doing this:

```js
// Boosted from Modernizr: https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/blob/master/feature-detects/history.js
// The stock browser on Android 2.2 & 2.3, and 4.0.x returns positive on history support
// Unfortunately support is really buggy and there is no clean way to detect
// these bugs, so we fall back to a user agent sniff :(

// We only want Android 2 and 4.0, stock browser, and not Chrome which identifies
// itself as 'Mobile Safari' as well, nor Windows Phone.

if (
    (userAgent.indexOf('Android 2.') !== -1 || userAgent.indexOf('Android 4.0') !== -1) &&
    userAgent.indexOf('Mobile Safari') !== -1 &&
    userAgent.indexOf('Chrome') === -1 &&
    userAgent.indexOf('Windows Phone') === -1
  ) {
    return false;
  }

  return Boolean(window.history && 'pushState' in window.history);
```

## Transition Path

We'll begin with deprecating auto, in next major release we
set history as the default. Since auto is default today,
and almost always resolve to history, most users won't need
to do a thing and they'll still get history location in the
next major release (but set directly, without auto resolving
to it).

There are two groups to consider though:

1. People who need auto-detection (hash/history switching) and
2. Those that have explicitly set location to 'auto'.

For the first group the solution is fairly trivial. Simply
implement feature detection, via e.g. Modernizr[1], like this:

```js
// app/router.js
export default class Router extends EmberRouter {
  location = (historyFeatureDetection() ? 'history' : 'hash');
  // â€¦
}
```

For the second group, they simply need to replace their explicit choice
of 'auto' for 'history' in `locationType` in environment.js (or
`location` in router.js), since history is what their 'auto' resolves
to anyway.

### What To Deprecate (and later remove)

- The HistoryLocation class
- The method `detect` from the `Location` interface
- Explicitly setting 'auto' as the preferred location.

### Deprecated or already private (should also be removed)
- Remove the `create` method on Location (replaced by registry)
- `registerImplementation` method on `Location`
- `supportsHistory` function exported in location/utils.ts

## How We Teach This

- Remove the text about auto location from guides.
- There is already good documentation about the different
  location types (history, hash, none) and how to write your own.
- Slight adjustments needed for the guides, removing mentions of auto[2].

Overall there should be fairly little changes to how Ember is taught. Since
the vast majority of users will need to make zero code changes and will have
zero change in actual behaviour.

## Drawbacks

Anyone using an unsupported browser will need to do feature detection
in their own code base or opt everyone into using the hash location.

## Alternatives

Do nothing.

## Unresolved questions

There are currently no unresolved questions.
